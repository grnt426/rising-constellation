If you want to compile the application inside of docker, make sure to use this command:

docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app elixir:1.17.3 sh -c "mix deps.get && mix compile"

Or some other command that ensures we use a non-interactive compilation. Just don't use:

docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app elixir:1.17.3 mix compile
